### Pre-sales Interactions

![presales interactions](/interactions/presalesInteractions.png)

Above is a graphic depicting the kinds of sales interactions that SEs have with prospects. We view sales interactions with the following lenses:

- X Axis - time. Where in the sales cycle progression does the interaction take place?
- Y Axis - technical depth
- Feature Set Coverage - broad vs. narrow
- Hands on or presentation?

This interaction chart helps us synthesize the kinds of assets that we need to support SEs and helps us determine where we have enough coverage and where we are lacking in terms of capabilities. AssetHub should be able to support SEs across a wide range of customer activities including the following:

- DSE Vanguard Workshop - Deep, Narrow interaction, sometimes hands on, where the goal is to prove out a specific functionality the customer wants to see working before closing a deal. This usually happens later in the sales cycle.
- Marketing Half-Day Technical Workshops - Higher level, broader interactions, usually hands on, designed to demonstrate the capabilities of DSE to a technical audience in order to get them aquainted with our technology. These are grass roots activities that happen early in the sales cycle.
- DSE Day - Art of the possible presentation / demo / design thinking session with the goal of demonstrating the power of DSE and facilitate brainstorming of customer use cases.
