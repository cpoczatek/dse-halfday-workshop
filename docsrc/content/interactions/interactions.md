## AssetHub and the Presales Lifecycle

AssetHub is designed to help us overcome technical barriers that arise during our sales motion. By thinking about the types of interactions we have with customers, we are better suited to synthesize the types of Assets that we need to build and use.

Above is a graphic depicting the kinds of sales interactions that SEs have with prospects. We view sales interactions with the following lenses:

- **X Axis** - time. Where in the sales cycle progression does the interaction take place?
- **Y Axis** - technical depth
- **Feature Set Coverage** - broad vs. narrow
- **Interactivity** - Hands-on or presentation?

Using this interactions chart, we came up with the following Field Asset types (you will see these in AssetHub application as a way to categorize assets on creation, curation, and search):

- **Feature Walkthrough** - Medium depth, narrow scope, hands-on, medium to late in the cycle. An introduction on how to use a particular feature of DSE. The focus is on accelerating a customer's skills development phase with a specific DSE functionality. The guide should go just deep enough to give the customer the confidence needed to buy. This does not replace enablement / training.
- **Demo** - High level, broad scope, usually not hands-on, early in the cycle. An "art of the possible" presentation / demonstration / design thinking session with the goal of demonstrating the power of DSE and facilitate brainstorming of customer use cases. These assets must be polished and include step-by-step scripts for presenting the demo.
- **DSE Proofshop** - Deep, narrow scope, sometimes hands-on, late in the cycle. A deep technical workshop where the goal is to prove out specific functionality the customer wants to see working before closing a deal. This usually happens later in the sales cycle.
- **Marketing Workshops** - Higher level, broader scope, usually hands-on, early in the cycle. A technical workshop designed to demonstrate the capabilities of DSE to a technical audience in order to get them acquainted with our technology. These are grass roots activities that are often planned in coordination with Marketing. These assets come with interactive notebooks for the students and presentation material for the instructors.


{{< note title="Note!" >}}
Most deals will only require one of these interactions and some may not require any at all. The goal is to use AssetHub to accelerate your sale. Adding unnecessary interactions can sometimes slow you down!
