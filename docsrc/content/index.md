This is a guide for how to use the powertools Half-Day Marketing Workshop brought to you by the DataStax field team.

### Motivation

Marketing Half-Day Technical Workshops are a high level, broad customer interaction, usually hands on, designed to demonstrate the capabilities of DSE to a technical audience in order to get them aquainted with our technology. These are grass roots activities that happen early in the sales cycle and are designed to generate interest in the DSE Stack.

This workshop is to give people a first look at the capabilities that DSE can offer. This is not meant to be a technical deep dive, but more to show off the power and features that DSE offers.

### What is included?

A Powerpoint presentation will walk the students through DSE. It is broken into multiple sections each with a hands on exercise:

* DSE Core
* DSE Search
* DSE Analytics
* DSE Opscenter / Security
